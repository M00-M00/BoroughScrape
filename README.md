# BoroughScrape

Works in progress on a number of scrapers for UK's borough Council websites. 
CLI is to be added, at the moment most websites (all apart from Harrow) can be parsed planning application for a certain period 
or for all cases available in weekly search (Midlothian, Barnet, Ediburgh).
More sites to be added too.
